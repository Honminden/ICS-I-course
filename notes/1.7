p1 x86
dominant server architecture

p4
Moore's Law
the number of transistors on an IC doubles every 18 months

p8
power limit -> multiple cores

p42
register: physical and logical
16+16 logical -> 128+128 physical
see CAAQA instead of CSAPP

p46
notice that x86 instructs are not equal in length (unfavorable)
RISC -> equal in length
ARM: dominant in the mobile area, charging for instruction usage
RISC-V: free, open-source
Intel: CISC outside but RISC inside

p49
malwares can change %rip to attack
