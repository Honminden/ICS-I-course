p9 byte
8 bits -> 128 (the first bit remained for +/-)

p13 int
finite numbers only in computer
too large -> overflow

p14 float
...overflow
too precise -> underflow

p17 hex <-> binary
1hex num <-> 4bit
1010 <-> A

p24 C program
vs. Java(OO)
C's problem: pointer -> memory leakage, blue screen

p33
gcc is complex
compliers are complex(and SS students are required to learn about them)

p35
x86 CISC(complex...)
    RISC -> less energy usage
Intel ATOM (for mobiles) -CISC
ARM -RISC

p53 mask
useful in network area
